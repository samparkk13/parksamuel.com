                Now that I am halfway through college, I wanted to take a moment to look back on my past 2 years. Specifically the first month of the past 2 years. It felt like a journey, and it's hard to believe that I still have 2 years left. But at the same time, it did go by so fast.
                <br />
                <br /> Cornell became like my second home, or even my first home. When I started to get homesick, it was when I was back home with my familyâ€¦
                <br />
                <br /> But I wanted to take a moment and relive the start of my freshman year, perhaps in the form of this blog.
                <br />
                <br /> My story begins on my move-in date: Wednesday, August 17th, 2022.

                After saying my final goodbyes to my family, my journey by myself began. I remember vividly walking my first steps as a student on campus, looking for some new or familiar faces, some other Korean students, but mostly with my roommate and long-time childhood friend, Shreyas.

                We didn't really know what to do or where to go, except to follow all the orientation events for first-year students. I felt like I was in a whole different world but at least we had each other.
