                Now that I am halfway through college, I wanted to take a moment to look back on my past two years, perhaps in the form of this blog. 
                Specifically, the first month of the past two years. 
                It felt like a journey, and it's hard to believe that I still have two years ahead of me. 
                <br />
                <br /> 
                But I wanted to take a moment and relive the beginning of my freshman year, perhaps in the form of this blog.
                <br />
                <br /> 
                Throughout this entry, you’ll get to see how Cornell became my second home. 
                Or even my first home, because I was homesick when I was back home with my family.


                <br />
                <br />
                I invite you to join me on my journey back to Fall 2022.

                <br /> I arrive at Cornell with a mix of emotions. Excited to move in and meet new people, but also nervous that I'll feel lonely. 
                <br />  
                Happy that I am free from my parents, but scared because I am free from my parents.

                After saying my final goodbyes to my family, this journey called college began.

                I remember vividly walking my first steps as a student on campus, looking for some new and familiar faces, 
                some other Korean students, but mostly with my roommate and long-time childhood friend, Shreyas.
                <br />
                <br /> We shared many firsts at Cornell together. First person to talk to in Ithaca, first dining hall experience, first night at our dorm room.

                We didn't really know what to do or where to go, except to follow all the orientation events for first-year students.

                <br /> The next day, Cornell hosted a First-Year Festival at Barton Hall. 
                This is where I met Robin. In our very brief conversation, we were able to introduce ourselves, 
                talk briefly about our faith, and exchange phone numbers.

                I had a friend that I knew from back at home that was also at Cornell, Matt. 
                After a few conversations back at home and a couple text messages shown below, 
                the three of us decided to check out some events and fellowships together.

            <br /> Throughout the weekend, I met many cool people with their own unique talents and learned how they got into Cornell. 
            A few, I could tell, lucked out. It was super cool nonetheless.

            Before I knew it, orientation week came to a close and my first weekend was well spent. 
            I spent most of my time at a church called Emmaus Road (we call it by its initials, ER). 
            I played lots of games with the people I met there, attended the beginning-of-the-year BBQ, went to Sunday service, and much more.

            <br />After all the orientation fun, it was time to be what I came here to be – an academic weapon. 
            <br />
            <br />However, I started to realize, the first week of school wasn’t gonna be loaded with work. 
            <br />
            <br />Actually, there was almost no work.
            <br />
            <br /> Robin and I pretty much did everything together ever during our first academic week here. 
            We ate together, “studied” together, went bowling together, and took naps throughout campus together.

                However, after a couple of nights, we noticed that these sophomores started to tire pretty easily.

                <br/> As a new month turned and August slipped away, 
                we realized that our small freshman hangout group was lacking one thing: sisters. 
                Robin and I remembered two freshmen sisters that we interacted with during orientation weekend, Ellie and Erin. 
                <br/>
                <br/>We decided to reach out to Ellie over text together, as this was a new and tall task. 
                We then had the conversation on text below.

                I’ll end this blog entry here, as writing about the memories made and the people met throughout my freshman year would make this one too long. 
                <br/>
                <br/>There are things that are forgettable from my first month at Cornell, such as my hair (or freshman fifteen) and awkward interactions. 
                But the unforgettable parts are the memories made along the way, each conversation I had, and the friendships that blossomed. 
                <br/>
                <br/>I realized that as this “friend group” began to grow closer together and in numbers throughout the year, 
                we weren’t really a friend group. 
                We were all brothers and sisters with a heart of curiosity, kindness, and most importantly, a mustard seed of faith. 
                <br/>
                <br/>My freshman year was marked by so many more memories and people that a short entry could never capture in its entirety. 
                But taking a glance back, it was fun making my first memories at Cornell with this group. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Seeing us all running this race together and now soon-to-be upperclassmen is something to look forward to!
