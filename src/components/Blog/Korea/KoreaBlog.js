            The summer of 2023 was a great couple months in my life. A time back at home and a time to recharge.
            <br />
            <br />
            As well as a time to visit Korea and the many extended family members there.
            <br />
            <br />
            Going to Korea is a once in a blue moon type of opportunity for many reasons. Plane ticket cost, length of flight, time commitmentâ€¦ the list goes on. 
            <br />
            <br />
            I figured that this time of my life would be an ideal time to take a quick trip to Korea. And so I decided to spend a little over two weeks with family and friends there.
            <br />
            <br />
            Throughout this blog, I will be reviewing some of my favorite meals and sharing some memorable places I visited.
