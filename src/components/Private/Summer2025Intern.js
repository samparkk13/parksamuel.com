                        This was my first interview process for summer 2025 and the process as a whole wasn't too difficult from a technical POV. 
                        The process definetly gave me a morale boost after not being able to land an internship all throughout sophomore year for the summer. 
                        The Karat interview were LC easy / medium and final round was all behavioral. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        One thing to note: the company overall moves pretty slow, maybe because they were also hiring very early on compared to other companies.
                        My recruiter also had a very slow response time and was out of office multiple times when I tried reaching out. I received my offer in September
                        after beginning to recruit in them in May, but I guess I learned that the market is pretty tough right now and I am honestly just thankful
                        for the opportunity.

                        I was actually invited to their open house, where I was exposed to the company and many of its workers.
                        The open house was pretty awesome: workplace smack in midtown NYC, good benefits, and great people.

                        I received a 423/600 on the codesignal, probably the reason why I got ghosted for a company like here.

                        I was kind of bummed with the rejection, I thought I had a decent shot and I was fairly proud of how I did on the OA.
                        I wanted to make it somewhat further in the process for the experience and to practice but it is what it is.

                        Palantir recruitment is known for being notoriously long however, so I guess I can say that I didn't have to go through that.
                        I just had to get numb to the feeling of getting rejected and try to move on for my upcoming OAs / interviews.

                        I applied with referral at first, but I bombed the OA + the OA was super difficult. 
                        Honestly, I was in disbelief, so I reapplied with another email w/out a referral and received the OA again, which was much much easier. 
                        I got a perfect score and solved it in pretty good time complexity too IMO. I guess the company wasn't for me though cus I got 
                        rejected for the CFG hackathon even after having a great OA

                        I remember the OA consisting of 3 questions, all LC easy / medium. 
                        The first one was a dictionary question, the second one was a FactorSum, and the last questions was a variation of sliding window. 
                        I passed all the test cases. The 1st round interview was a pretty chill behavioral interview with the team's SDE manager. All behavioral
                        questions and STAR responses. The second round was a technical interview with a SDE on the team, and we went through LC-style coding 
                        questions. I was able to get through 1st problem and solve 2nd problem but not most efficiently. both problems seemed to be LC easy/mid questions.

                        Honestly, looking back at this recruitment process I think there were definetly areas that I could have brushed up on, but the interview experience
                        nice to have under my belt. Mock interviews and having better prepped answers to behavioral questions that align better with the company values 
                        were some of the takeaways that I had from this process.

                        I took the 2-hour OA for Amazon over the summer, and tbh I don't remember much from it except for the fact that it was pretty long.
                        I remember passing 15/15 test cases on the first question and 10/15 test cases on the second, but that's all I can remember. 
                        The OA also had a lengthy behavioral section.

                        The recruiter I talked to during the behavioral screen was one of the most chill dudes I talked to.
                        He was very nice and relaxed, making this screen a very smooth process. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I heard back about the final round interview a few days afterwards, which was a 45-minute behavioral and a 45-minute technical interview back-to-back.
                        The behavioral interview were just situational questions bombarded at me and I tried to answer them as best as I could from 
                        my knowledge and past experience. The technical interview was much more chill and I was given a LC style question, which I was able to solve in 
                        the given time. I had some time left over to optimize my solution, but I ran out of time before I was able to cook one up. The interviewer was 
                        really nice though and as I was implementing my solution, I felt like I was able to really explain my thought process well to her. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Overall, it was a great recruitment process with fast response times and good communication.
